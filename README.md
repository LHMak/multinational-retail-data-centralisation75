# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation project

## Project Description

I am undertaking this project as part of the AiCore Cloud Engineering pathway. The aim of this project is to collate, clean and centralise the sales data from a fictional multinational company. 

The company sells goods across the globe and their sales data is spread across many different data sources. This means the data is not easily accessible or analysable.

In order to remedy this issue, this project will:

1. Retrieve all data from the various sources such as: AWS S3 buckets, AWS cloud databases and APIs hosted on AWS. The data also takes many forms such as: PDFs, .json and .csv.
  - This will require me to change my approach for each datasource
